# Real2Synth Evaluation Metrics (SynthOCT Challenge)

**Python codes for quantitative evaluation of synthetic OCT scans against real data using SSIM on structural, OAC, and Speckle Contrast maps.**

This repository contains the evaluation framework developed for the **SynthOCT Challenge**. It provides tools to objectively validate the quality of synthetic Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) B-scans by comparing them with real clinical data.

Unlike standard image translation metrics, this evaluation pipeline incorporates physics-based metrics—Optical Attenuation Coefficient (OAC) and Speckle Contrast (SC)—to ensure the synthetic data is not only structurally similar but also physically plausible.
